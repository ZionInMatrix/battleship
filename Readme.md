# Battleship V1.0. Console-game in Java 1 vs 1.

## Game description:
The objective of the game is figuring out where these ships are placed and hit them. Each damaged part of the ship is displayed as "X" 
and if you miss it is marked as ".".

## Game process:
1. Start the game
2. Each player will enter their name
3. Each player will choose the location of the ships and choose in which plane horizontally or vertically
4. Each player, starting from the first player, will start choosing the location of the ships
5. If you don't have time for the game, and you haven't finished playing, you can stop the game with the opportunity to continue it until you win
6. If you want to continue the game you need to enter the word "yes" or start a new game, which you will be prompted for in the game console
